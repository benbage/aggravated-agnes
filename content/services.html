<h2>Clinical Pilates Training</h2>
<p>Clinical Pilates helps to retrain movement and function within the central 'core' whilst co-ordinating the limbs. The core muscles are made up of the spinal stabilisers, gluts, abdominal musculature and postural stabilisation muscles. This is a gentle form of exercise that can be used by sporty or non-sporty people for rehabilitation or to develop strength and endurance of the core musculature. This form of exercise is particularly useful for those suffering from SIJ dysfunction, recurrent hamstring tears, knee pain, neck pain, cervicogenic headaches, shoulder impingement, kyphosis, lordosis, scoliosis, spondylolythesis, and disc prolapse. As well as being a great tool to develop top sports performers into robust, strong athletes helping them perform more efficiently! Many exercises are incorporated into rehabilitation during treatments but this can also be done in a 1 to 1 session to really target the correct movement and retrain dysfunction in the body. <br>
Appointments- 60 minutes <strong>£40</strong> including 6 week individual program to be followed with progressions.<br>
</p>

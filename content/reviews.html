<q>Following a fall from a horse in August 2011 I saw Anna every week for 7 months to treat a massive haematoma on my hip.  She was fabulous and through lymphatic drainage massage managed to get rid of it.  She also fixed all the other problems that walking around lop sided caused from time to time.  Anna is extremely professional and so lovely to see - I missed our chat once the treatment was done! </q>

<q>Just wanted to say a big thank you for the bright blue Rock Taping that you did for me for the Mid Sussex Triathlon the other week.... it was ace! I think it really helped and I was rather reluctant to remove it when it eventually started to flap about a bit more than was reasonable some days later! As I'm not local I'm unfortunately unable to come back and be retaped and/or manipulated further but wanted to say thank you - I was the lady with the post tib thing and the low back thing going on who you managed to make jump (several times) almost off your couch that day (much to the amusement of the onlookers!). The race went well although it was cold and windy so I was rather pleased when I was back indoors with a hot cup of tea! Anyway, I hope that the event was helpful for you and that some new folk will come your way as a result - they should - you were ace!</q>

 <q>I took up Rugby at the end of 2011 after playing basketball for a long time. With a new sport came new challenges, especially for my body!! I was diagnosed with a bulging disc at the base of my spine that was putting pressure on my sciatic nerve. This was causing pain before, during and after both training and games. This was somewhat controlled by medication. However since seeing Anna for treatment through the rugby club I started to feel a huge difference. It was taking me less time to recover, the pain was reduced and my range of movement was increased and the medication stopped. This happened through the sports massage treatment that Anna was able to provide on a regular basis. Anna was also able to give me exercises to take home and do with no specialist equipment so costs were kept low.
Playing regular rugby takes its toll but fortunately the sports massage treatment that Anna has given me means I am always ready to play again sooner than i think.

<q>I have known Anna for a few years now. I find her to be very knowledgeable and confident in her field. I often approach Anna for advice about sports massage if I needed to discuss an issue that has arisen. I have attended training sessions run by Anna and have found her approach very relaxing and professional whilst the content fun and informative. </q>

<q>After years spent suffering intermittent back and neck pain, my chiropractor recommended sports massage therapy in general and Anna in particular. Anna has been looking after my back for some 18 months now, and in that time has transformed it ! With regular massage therapy and with the benefit of simple exercises suggested by Anna, I no long fall prone to back spasms and pain. Where chiropractors and osteopaths used to treat the effect, Anna has actually treated the cause. It’s fantastic to have a pain-free back ! I would, without hesitation, thoroughly recommend Anna to anyone who suffers with back pain. She’s a miracle worker! </q>

<q>Anna was responsible for devising our squads training sessions from an early morning fitness and power session, to more traditional strength and conditioning sessions. Anna has a real passion for her work and has a professionalism that I have rarely seen in sports coaching. She listens and responds to her clients but also has the expert knowledge to know what is best and is willing to put her foot down! Our squad had massive improvements in our performance this year, largely due to the efforts of Anna and her coaching skills.</q>

<q>I tore my hamstring in the spring but didn't know the extent of how bad it was until I saw Anna. She told me exactly what I had done and how bad it was. I went to her on 2-3 occasions and received sports massage to get rid of the scar tissue and to speed up the process of my recovery. She gave me a foam roller so I could do massages at home and also gave me exercises to do inbetween each session. 6 months down the line I'm back running and my leg is almost fully healed. Thank You Anna for all your help!! </q>

<q>Anna was my course tutor for my ITEC Level 3 Sports Massage qualification. This was my first experience of ITEC exams and she was great at making everything seem simple. She also taught us not only what we needed to know to complete the course but gave us so many extra techniques that I have used in my professional career now. She was also such a good mentor and always there to answer any questions. Her enthusiasm and passion for sports massage definitely had a huge effect on me and has encouraged me to want to provide the best treatment for my patients in my career now. I would highly recommend her as a course tutor. </q>

<q>Whilst training for an ironman triathlon, I was foolish enough to take flight from my bike in excess of 30mph and cushion the blow with my shoulder (October), resulting in a separated AC joint. Anna got me back and training within the week and helped manage the recovery in the next few months, so that training over the winter saw minimum disruption. In an even bigger bout of foolishness, after reading 'Born to Run', a book extolling the virtues of barefoot running, just two weeks before the start line of my first ironman, I woke up one Monday morning and felt inspired to run some 4 miles barefoot. (The next chapter of the book, advised a very slow build up to this type of running, ideally starting with no more than 400m!) The resulting calf agonies could well have seen me not making the start line, but yet again, Anna's magic massage and taping saved the day and I am pleased to say I completed the ironman in July, mostly with a smile on my face and not too much pain. </q>

  <q>Anna continued communicating with me throughout the treatment and always responded to my questions without her own agenda. She’s quietly spoken and friendly but has a strong firm touch. She always explained what muscles she was working on and what she was doing and what she would do next. Anna is thoroughly professional and naturally delivered she is very intuitive as to the areas that need work, as if she’s been doing it all her life! She advised me about my hydration and race nutrition and gave me stretches to correct my areas of tightness for the muscles that were causing my knee pain. She also gave some excellent prevention exercises for the future. </q>

<q>Throughout my treatment Anna has kept informed about my recovery, her wide range of knowledge about the body means I feel confident in everything she tells me and confident in her ability to get me back to full fitness. Furthermore her friendly manner means during treatment I feel comfortable and this helps when she performs deep tissue massage on my hamstring! </q>

<q>I started rowing when I joined University 3 years ago as a mature student, after a career which involved training and riding racehorses. I have always maintained a fair level of fitness with upper body strength but which I soon learned was not specific to rowing. A new training regime was required to adapt to using different muscles. 
I undertook the Strength and Conditioning training programme in order to improve my rowing by gaining a better technique through improved core strength and to increase my power/speed.
 I feel that in my third year I have really improved as I keep achieving personal bests on all my ergo tests. My improved level of fitness and strength is now beginning to achieve noticeable results especially in races.
On April 1st I undertook a rowing marathon, 50k, with only 6 weeks of marathon training. The training was intense, building up to 110k water training in the penultimate week. I feel that having undertaken 6 months of S & C training with Anna Hopcroft. I was able to withstand the punishing schedule without serious injury. Any injuries were dealt with through vital rehabilitation sessions. Not only was I able to compete in the marathon but I surpassed any expectations by winning my category. This was an incredible personal achievement and I feel that I owe a massive debt of gratitude to Anna Hopcroft for her professionalism. The advice and support given is tremendous and I now feel that to continue with the S & C training will only reap even more benefits and I look forward to winning regattas this summer. </q>

<q> After suffering a muscle strain of my right calf, I saw Anna who treated me then taped my calf in order for me to race the ½ Ironman in Antwerp 3 days later. After worrying for weeks that I would be unable to complete the event, Anna’s taping was more than brilliant, completing the run with little pain afterwards – thank you. </q>

<h3>Pilates for Weightlifters Workshop</h3><p>
I thoroughly enjoyed the workshop and look forward to putting everything I learnt into practise to help improve my strength. I particularly liked the explanation Anna gave of the difference between local and global muscles used in Pilates and weightlifting. This was most useful. I would definitely recommend this to others.  </q>

Great venue, professional, knowledgeable, felt at home. Good equipment and facilities. The workshop was a good length of time. Anna gave clear and detailed instructions throughout. It was worth every penny. I hope for more workshops in the future and would totally recommend this to my colleagues.</q>

<h3>Pilates for Weightlifters Workshop</h3><p>
Annas excellent knowledge base and coaching points made this a very valuable and relevant workshop. For both my own training and that of my clients. All elements were useful and I liked the explanation on spinal compression in Pilates and weightlifting that Anna gave. It would be great to follow this up with some lifting, maybe at another workshop?</q>

A fantastic workshop which gave an in-depth practical study of Pilates assistance exercises. I can see my mobility improving as a result. I particularly liked the way Anna explained why the exercise was being performed and the context of its application to weightlifters.</q>

<h3>Sports Taping Workshop</h3><p>
Anna's sports taping workshop was relevant and covered everything that I wanted it too. I found the comparison of different taping methods and their uses really helpful and we just about had enough time to practise everything! It was fantastic and really inspired me to try out new tapes and methods with my clients and potentially move onto a more specialist course in the future. </q>

<q> <h3>Tui Bee Balm</h3><p>
Bee balm is a great all-round product. I started using it for stretchmarks when I was pregnant, and have since used it to soothe my dry, cracked hands and moisturise and soften old scars. I would also feel confident using it on my baby's skin as it is so gentle, and I think it is an essential for the bathroom cabinet! </q>
